## Subway Freedom
## Create unlimited entrances and platforms with different elevation.
## How to use it:

You can watch the linked youtube video to understand how it works or read bellow.

## ALWAYS PLACE EVERYHING USING ANARCHY
- 1 Create a Subway Station Module: Place the module somewhere you will be able to click later. You will need that to add more upgrades.

- 2 Place a platform: You can choose the elevation level and if it's strait or curved. Use anarchy and disable snapping to place anywhere you want. You can add as many as you want.

- 3 Place an entrance: To the passengers to have access, place and entrance on the side of a road or connect invisble pedestrian paths to it. You can have have as many as you want.

- 4 See the magic.

- 5 To delete/move the module and upgrades, click on the module and delete all of its sub-building on the info pannel. You can also click any sub-building and go to the main building to check all of the upgrades. Look for the known issues below.

# KNOWN ISSUES:
- When trying to delete the subway module, the other connections will stay. Please delete entrances and platforms before deleting the subway module.

- This is not an issue but something from the game. If you need to move entrances or platforms, you'll have to click on them and use the realocate button. If you use move it, everything from the building will be moved together. This happens for other in game building as well so there's no fix for it.

# ALWAYS PLACE EVERYHING USING ANARCHY

### Create a Subway Station Module. Place the module on a road because it has service needs.

### Place a platform. You can choose the elevation level. Use anarchy and disable snapping to place anywhere you want(It's not works for the vanilla entrance. this will be fixed). You can add as many as you want.

### Place an entrance. To the passengers to have access, place and entrance on the side of a road or connect invisble pedestrian paths to it. You can have have as many as you want.

### See the magic.
